/*LOOPS

Instead of writing out the same code over and over, letâ€™s make the computer loop through our array for us. We can do this with for loops.

The syntax looks like this:

var animals = ["Grizzly Bear", "Sloth", "Sea Lion"];

for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
  console.log(animals[i]);
}

// Output:
// Grizzly Bear
// Sloth
// Sea Lion
Since this syntax is a little complicated, let's break it into 4 parts:

Within the for loop's parentheses, the start condition is var i = 0, which means the loop will start counting at 0.
The stop condition is i < animals.length, which means the loop will run as long as i is less than the length of
the animals array. When i is greater than the length of the animals array, the loop will stop looping.
The iterator is i++. This means that each loop, i will have 1 added to it.
And finally, the code block is inside the { ... }. The block will run each loop, until the loop stops.
The secret to loops is that i, the variable we created inside the for loop's parentheses, is always equal to a number.
To be more clear, the first loop, i will equal 0, the second loop, i will equal 1, and the third loop, i will equal 2.

This makes it possible to write animals[0], animals[1], animals[2] programmatically instead of by hand.
We can write a for loop, and replace the hard coded number with the variable i, like this: animals[i].

  for (var j = 0; j < friendPlaces.length; j++) {
        console.log(friendPlaces[j]);

    if (myPlaces[i] === friendPlaces[j]) {
    			console.log('Match: ' + myPlaces[i]);

  var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4);

  currentCard = cards[randomNumber];
}

console.log('Found a Spade!');
