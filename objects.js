/*
So instead of using the Object constructor which is empty and has no properties, we can make our own constructors which have properties.

To see how this works, look at our Person constructor in lines 1â€“4. This constructor is used to make Person objects.
Notice it uses the keyword this to define the name and age properties and set them equal to the parameters given.

In a constructor, we don't have to define all the properties using parameters.
Look at our new Person example on line 1, and see how we set the species to be "Homo Sapiens" (line 4).
This means that when we create any Person, their species will be "Homo Sapiens".
In this way, the values associated with name and age are not yet assigned, but species will always have the same value.
